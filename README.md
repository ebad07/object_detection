In this project we have included object detection model using Tensorflow Object Detection API
The project was completed in Google Colaboratory
We have installed the necessary libraries to run in Colab
We have used pycocotools which is a Python API that assists in loading, parsing and visualizing the annotations in COCO.
COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, person keypoints detection, stuff segmentation, and caption generation.
Also wehave used Protobuf(a.k.a., protobuf) which are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
Then we have imported the necessary libraries to run in Colab.
Initially we have used 'SSD with Mobilenet' model with which we have achieved very less accuracy.
With the help of Web API we were able to capture image in Colab.
With the help of 'mask_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco' we were able to attain accuracy above 90 per cent.
